<p>Growing up, I never really thought about what I could do, could not do or whose description of the world I borrowed to define me or my environment. I moved through education systems, institutions, corporations and societies like all of us do. Now, when I am a tax paying adult trying to carve out my own identity, the influence of the narratives I have consumed is becoming palpable to me. All those missing women, who look like me, talk like me, struggle like me, from everything I have consumed, has left a rift in my imagination about what I myself can do. All those missing narratives has also left me disconnected with the stories of people like me. Its like I live in someone else's world and not mine at all. </p>

<p> So I started hunting. For women writers whose stories I could connect with, for women rappers and poets (I listen to a LOT of rap music, maybe a blog on that later), for women painters I could find in the museums I visited all over the world, for women leaders who could represent my interests, for women scientists and engineers I could see as role models. I have felt exhilaration each time I have connected or was well represented. But mostly I have felt frustration and shock at how little content by women, or for that matter, anyone who does not belong to the privileged group, is easily accessible. The privilege of narrative is a steep wall to climb to if you are on the wrong side.</p>

<h5>Who am I?</h5> 

<p>I am a scientist and an engineer from India, living in the Netherlands. I care deeply about climate change mitigation, go for D.I.Y. where I can, and like to explore stories from the margins of the world through books, art and music.</p>
